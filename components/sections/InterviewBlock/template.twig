          For the record, I prefer to call them crypto assets, or crypto coins, as they have little
          to do with the fiat currencies of our world. The focus on the coins’ volatility and
          operational issues, including energy costs, will prove to be a distraction in the grand
          scheme of things. What has become ever clearer in recent years is that the blockchain
          revolution will have much deeper consequences, and will most likely disrupt not only
          financial services, but will propagate across all sectors throughout the economy, as
          businesses rely more and more heavily on technology. We are entering a new era of Web 3.0
          where decentralisation of technology and internet will rule."
