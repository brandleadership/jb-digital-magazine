            We firmly believe that there is more to blockchain technology than
            its use merely for digital transactions. We understand the
            technology as an enabler of the next technical revolution, affecting
            not only the financial world, but economies and societies as a
            whole.<ul>

                    <b>Healthcare:</b> Patient records are cumbersome to share â€“
                    this is the status quo in most healthcare systems. Having health-related
                    records stored on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain,
                    enables faster access, especially relevant in an emergency, and
                    can enable anonymous patient data analysis on a scale previously
                    unknown.
